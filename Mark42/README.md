# Iron Man Mark 42 Helmet

This is a 3D printed replica of the Mark 42 Helmet from Iron Man 3. I did not create the 3D files myself but all 
code used to run the helmet are of my own creation. This turned out to be a really cool project and I had fun,
not only with the computer engineering part of this, but with the physical craft part of this as well.
